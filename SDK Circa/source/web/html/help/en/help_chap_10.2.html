			Anybody is given an opportunity to warn the moderator about abuses. By following the link titled &quot;Signal an abuse&quot;, one reach a page where one can, optionally, give the grounds of one's alerting.
		</p>
		<p>
			The administrators of the &quot;Newsgroups&quot; service, as well as the moderator, are emailed the information.
			The icon (&nbsp;<img src="../../../images/extension/help/Newsgroups-Abuse%20marked%20up.PNG" alt="Abuse post" />&nbsp;) is displayed besides the author name, on the topic page.
			Drawing the mouse over it will briefly display the message of the abuse-reporter.<br/>
			The moderators and leaders can remove the marked abuse by pressing on icon (&nbsp;<img src="../../../images/extension/help/Newsgroups%20-%20Remove%20abuse.PNG" alt="Remove abuse" />&nbsp;).

		<p>
		Now you can use, manage or moderate forums at your convenience. Discussions can also be launched outside the newsgroups. Users, for example, may have an exchange about a document uploaded to the library. This is the subject of next chapter.
