	  	<h3>How can I start or stop receiving notifications?</h3>

		<p>
			Your <b>notification status</b>, indeed, indicates under which conditions you can or cannot get
			the notifying e-mails. It is made of:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A global authorisation</li>
			<li>A user notification status</li>
			<li>A profile notification status</li>
		</ul>

	  	<br />
		<div class="printScreen">
            <img alt="By default, no event is notified." title="By default, no event is notified." src="../../../images/extension/help/Notifications_default%20status.PNG" />
            <br />
            <span>The notifications default to off</span>
		</div>
		<br />

		<p>
			You can edit the two first options whereas only the IG Leader is able to let a whole
			group of users (all users with a same profile) subscribe
		</p>

		<h4>A global authorization</h4>

		<p>
			As soon as you get connected, press the <b>"Administration"</b> link from the CIRCABC "main menu".
			Click the <b>"Manage your account"</b> option. Your user account is displayed.
			Scroll down to its <b>"user options"</b> section and turn <b>"Global notifications"</b> to "enable".
			At last, press on the "Save" button at the top-right corner of the "Manage your account" form.
		</p>

		<br />
		<div class="printScreen">
            <img alt="Enable global notifications and you will start receiving warnings" title="Enable global notifications and you will start receiving warnings" src="../../../images/extension/help/Notifications-%20turn%20to%20enabled.PNG" />
            <br />
            <span>Enable the notifications to reach your mailbox</span>
		</div>
		<br />

		<h4>A notification status for user</h4>

		<p>
			Once you have set "global notification" to "enabled" (do not forget that this is a sine qua non of
			receiving notifications), you have to check your user notification status.
			This must be set to "subscribed" to let warnings reach your mailbox.
			This status, however, defaults to "unsubscribed".
			It can be defined by your interest group leader but you are free to change it.
			As a matter of notifications, indeed, the will of users prevails.
		</p>

		<a name="UnotifStatus" ></a>
		<p>
			Now let us see <b>how to modify this profile</b>.
		</p>

		<p>
			You select <b>"Administration"</b> from the main menu of the interest group.
			You are proposed various actions, according to the role you may play.
			If you have been granted the lowest role in each service, that is to say <b>"access"</b>,
			you can see at least the <b>two options illustrated below</b>.
		</p>

		<br />
		<div class="printScreen">
            <img alt="Modify your notification status to be notified of uploads" title="Modify your notification status to be notified of uploads" src="../../../images/extension/help/Notifications-%20administration%20console.PNG" />
            <br />
            <span>How to subscribe the alert service for all or a part of your interest group</span>
		</div>
		<br />

		<p>
			You choose <b>"Edit own notification status"</b>.
			The three components of your status are then displayed.
			You can notice that "notification profile for user" is editable.
			Turn it to "subscribed" if it is still in its default position and that you wish to be warned of
			new uploads.
		</p>

		<br />
		<div class="printScreen">
            <img alt="Subscribe the notification service" title="Subscribe the notification service" src="../../../images/extension/help/Notifications-%20user%20subscribed.PNG" />
            <br />
            <span>Edit the notification status</span>
		</div>
		<br />

		<p>
			Now you can receive the notifications about events occurring anywhere in the Library and the Newsgroups.
		</p>

		<h4>A notification status for profile</h4>

		<p>
			Your interest group leader can determine a notification status to be applied to all the users who
			share a same user profile. For instance, all of the "authors" will receive the notifications about
			documents uploaded into the Library and none of them will be informed about the messages exchanged
			through such or such forum of the Newsgroups service.
		</p>

		<p>The interest group leaders are the only ones who may define or modify a profile notification status.</p>

		<div class="borderNotCenter">
			<h4>So, let us imagine that, as a "contributor" I may not receive emails about documents loaded in a section of the Library. But I really wish to get them. What can I do?</h4>
			<p>
				- Do not let it worry you! Just remember that your user notification status prevails over the profile
				status notification. So, you will just turn the user notification status to "subscribed".
			</p>

	  	<h3>How can I receive only targeted notifications?</h3>

		<p>
			Would you prefer to be alerted to contents just loaded in a certain sub-space of the Library?
			Or would you be interested in the messages sent via one forum, not others?
			This is really easy to obtain.
		</p>

		<h4>Being warned of events in one space the interest group</h4>

		<p>
			We have just seen
            <a title="Define your notification status" href="#UnotifStatus"><b>how to set your notification status</b></a>
            at the root of the interest group.
			This action covers the whole library and newsgroups.
			But the notification process can be limited to a space of the interest group, as well.
			This means that you can get (or the interest group leader can let you get) warnings concerning the only
			library or the only newsgroups service.
		</p>

		<p>
			For instance, we shall consider  that you wish to be informed about any new upload occurred
			in the Library but you are not interested in the dialogs taking place in the various for a of
			the newsgroup service.<br />
			You simply select "Library" and then "Administration" from the main menu.
			Now you repeat, at the level of the library what was
			<a title="Define your notification status" href="#UnotifStatus"><b>explained above</b></a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			To make sure not to be notified of the newsgroups, repeat this process after having selected
			Newsgroups from the main menu of the interest group and set "user notification status" to "unsubscribed".
		</p>

		<a name="UnotifInherit" ></a>
		<div class="borderNotCenter">
			<h4>I read "inherited" in my user notification status at the level of the Library. What does it mean?</h4>
			<p>
				- <b>"Inherited"</b> means that you are granted, at the level of the Library,
				same permissions as you have at the level of the interest group.
				If you are uncertain about your status at the root of the interest group and wish to check it,
				click on the name of the interest group in the left-handed main menu.
				Then go to "administration" and "Edit own notification status".
			</p>
			<p>
				- If you can read <b>"subscribed"</b> besides "user notification status", do not change anything:
				you have inherited the permission of receiving notifications at the level of the library, as well.
				In the opposite, if "unsubscribed" is written, go back to the Library and activate the
				"administration"/"Edit own notification status" at this level.
				Now turn "user notification status" from "inherited" to "subscribed".
				You will receive the notifications of new uploads without receiving anything about the
				messages going off and on through the newsgroups.
			</p>
		</div>

		<h4>Being warned of events in one sub-space of the Library</h4>

		<p>
			The following explanation is valuable for one or some forums of Newsgroups as well.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you wish to keep aware of the life of only certain sections of the Library,
			you browse to each these sections and repeat, at their level, the process
			<a title="Define your notification status" href="#UnotifStatus"><b>explained above</b></a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			If, here too, you find "inherited" as a status, please look at the short
			<a href="#UnotifInherit" title="What does 'inherited' mean?"><b>dialog above</b></a>.
