	  	<h3>What is notified?</h3>

		<p>You can ask for getting a notification whenever a member of the Interest Group</p>

		<ul>
			<li>uploads a document in the Library</li>
			<li>expresses oneself via the Newsgroups</li>
		</ul>

		<p>In the library, the notified uploads include:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>The initial uploading of new documents (standard, bulk or via e-mail)</li>
			<li>The updating of contents </li>
			<li>an existing document to be replaced by a new version</li>
			<li>a translation to be added to a multilingual document</li>
		</ul>

		<p>In the newsgroups, are notified: </p>

		<ul>
			<li>the adding of a new topic in a forum</li>
			<li>the answer to a message posted via a forum</li>
		</ul>

	  	<h3>What does a notification look like?</h3>

		<p>
			CIRCABC sends short e-mails showing a link to the notified content,
			its location and main properties. In the specific case of a topic in an
			ongoing conversation, the e-mail also contains the body of the message posted.

	  	<h3>Who does receive notifications?</h3>

		<p>
			This service is reserved for the <b>members of the interest group</b> (the profile "<b>access</b>"
			is enough for being able to accept or reject notifications).
			The interest group leader may choose which users and which type of users will receive notifications.
		</p>
		<div class="borderText">
			<p>But remember that the notification service is first of all tailored to your needs.</p>
			<p>Whatever was decided by the IG Leader, <b>you can at any time set your own user notification status</b>.</p>
