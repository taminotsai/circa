		<h4>More about "Events"</h4>
		
		<p>
			Events look like meetings, the only difference being that the invitees to an event <b>cannot
			accept nor refuse to attend.</b><br/>
			Like meetings, events can be <u>"open" or closed"</u>, <u>"single" or "repeated"</u>.<br/>
			You can be notified by email. In this case, repeated events will be listed all together in a
			single message.
		</p>

		<h4>More about "Meetings"</h4>
		<p>
			Everybody is liable to attend meetings scheduled in every interest group on CIRCABC.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Meetings can be "open" or "closed".
			<b>Open</b> meetings are limited to the membership of your interest group. No request meeting is
			created in the event manager of your mailbox (unless the IG Leader specifically ask for a
			request to be created for every member of the interest group).
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<b>Closed</b> meetings can bring together:
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>members of your interest group</li>
			<li>members of any other interest group on CIRCABC</li>
			<li>registered users (users with an identifier) being not invited in any interest group</li>
			<li>anonymous users (users without identifier)</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>
			Every invitee receives a meeting request in the event manager of their email service.
			The details of meetings are recorded in the Events service.
		</p>
		
		<div class="borderNotCenter">
			<br />
			<ul>
				<li>
				You just told me that I may be invited to a meeting organised by a different interest
				group. Let us suppose I have no membership of this other group. How to get information
				about the meeting in question? How to confirm or refuse to participate?
				</li>
				<li>
				When invited to attend a closed meeting, you receive a meeting request giving you the
				opportunity to accept or decline invitation. You can also take advantage of this message
				for asking details about the appointment.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br /><br />

		<h4>Details of a meeting</h4>
		
		<p>
			Enter your interest group and select the option "Events" from the main menu. Having selected
			a date on the calendar, click on the starting hour of the meeting. Its details are displayed.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>In the following example, we want to know more about a meeting which starts at 15:45 on
2009-04-01:</i>

            <span>The general information is displayed among other details</span>
		</div>

			The illustration above shows the details of a single meeting: the "date" and "start date" are the
			same. In the case of a repeated meeting, "date" contains the date of the occurrence you are
			checking.

            <span>Only one meeting request will be created, on the date of 05-04-09, with every occurrence listed</span>
		</div>
		
		<h4>Make your choice</h4>
		
		<p>
			If the meeting is closed and you have received a meeting request (or an event has been created
			in your mailbox), you are free to reply and ask for further information or make your choice.
			<br/>
			On the other hand, the view of the meeting details gives you an opportunity to answer to the
			invitation.
