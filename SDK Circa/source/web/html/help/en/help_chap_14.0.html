			With the <b>information service</b>, users outside the interest group, as far as granted rights
			enough, can browse an overview of your interest group as it was a website.
		</p>

		<p>
			This service consists of two parts:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>A repository: information to be published is stored there</li>
			<li>A publishing area: this is the place where links to information are published</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Users granted with the role <b>infaccess</b> can browse the service and look at the links placed in
			the publishing area.<br/>
			Those who play a role as infadmin can:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>upload, modify, remove documents on the repository</li>
			<li>create links to be published in the publishing area</li>
			<li>manage users' rights over the information service</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			As a leader of your interest group, you have been given the role <b>infadmnin</b> by default
