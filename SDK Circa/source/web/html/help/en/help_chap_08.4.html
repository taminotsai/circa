	  	<h3>How can I add translations?</h3>

		<p>CIRCABC-IPM allows you to start the "Add translation" process from three possible starting points:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>from the "View details" page of any multilingual document;</li>
			<li>from the "manage multilingual content" page;</li>
			<li>from any other translation of the original document.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>From the "View details" page of any multilingual document</h4>

		<ul>
			<li>"Add translation" may be run from the "Actions" pane of the "View details" page of the multilingual document:</li>
		</ul>

		<br />
		<div class="printScreen">
            <img alt="Add translations via the 'view details' page" title="Add translations via the 'view details' page" src="../../../images/extension/help/Add%20translation-bis.PNG" />
            <br />
            <span>Add translations via the "View details" page</span>
		</div>
		<br />

		<h4>From the manage multilingual content page</h4>

		<p>
			Once you have picked <b>Manage multilingual content</b> out of the <b>Actions</b> list of the "View details" page,
			select "Add translation" as shown below:
		</p>

		<br />
		<div class="printScreen">
            <img alt="Add a translation via 'Manage multilingual content'" title="Add a translation via 'Manage multilingual content'" src="../../../images/extension/help/Manage%20MLC%20WAI.PNG" />
            <br />
            <span>Add translations via "Manage multilingual content"</span>
		</div>
		<br />

		<h4>From any other translation of the original document</h4>

		<p>You can increase a series of translations starting from any related translation since each of these is a multilingual document.</p>

		<div class="topOfPage">
			<a href="#top" class="top">Top of the page&nbsp;<img src="../../../images/extension/help/top_ns.gif" alt="back to the top of the page" /></a>

	  	<h3>How can I add translations with content?</h3>

		<p>
			First, make sure that the content where you are ready to add a translation is really multilingual.
			If not, make it multilingual following the <a href="help.jsp?page=help_chap_08.3.html">"Make multilingual"</a> procedure.
			<i>(see "Dealing with multilingual documents"; "Making multilingual  "; "How to do").</i>
		</p>

		<p>
			Run <b>Add translation</b> from any of the three above-listed locations. As a result, the first screen of the "Add translation" form is shown, requesting you for searching the file to be uploaded.
		</p>

		<br />
		<div class="printScreen">
            <img alt="How to add a translation with content... First step" title="How to add a translation with content... First step" src="../../../images/extension/help/Add%20Translations%20WAI.PNG" />
            <br />
            <span>How to add a translation with content... First step</span>
		</div>
		<br />

		<p>
			You <b>select</b> the translation file to be added and confirm your decision by pressing
			on the "<b>Upload</b>" button. This guides you to the second step of the "Add translation"
			process which consists of detailing the properties of the translation you are adding.
			Finally, you are requested for indicating the language of the uploaded content.
		</p>

		<br />
		<div class="printScreen">
            <img alt="How to add a translation with content... Last step" title="How to add a translation with content... Last step" src="../../../images/extension/help/Add%20Translations%20WAI%202nd%20step.PNG" />
            <br />
            <span>How to add a translation with content... Last step</span>
		</div>
		<br />

		<br>
		<div class="borderText">
			<br />
			<i>
				The symbol <img alt="Required field" title="Required field" src="../../../images/extension/help/required_field.gif" />
				next to "Name" and "Language" indicates that both <b>these fields are mandatory</b>.
			</i>
			<br /><br />
		</div>
		<br />

		<p>
			You are requested for <b>detailing the language of the translation</b>.
			As soon as selected, each language is taken out of the list.
			<b>The reason why is that you may not add more than one of each linguistic version</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once you have typed in the right language and pressed on the OK button,
			you are proposed to <b>modify the properties</b> of the translation.
			If you need not to modify anything, just press on <b>OK</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now the translation appears as a new content:
		</p>
		<br />
		<div class="printScreen">
            <img alt="A new translation has been added" title="A new translation has been added" src="../../../images/extension/help/New%20translation.PNG" />
            <br />
            <span>A new translation has been added</span>
		</div>
		<br />

		<p><b>Please, notice</b> that:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				The language codes have been made visible because we have selected "All languages"
				as Content language filter.
			</li>
			<li>
				By clicking either the PDF icon next to each content name or the content names themselves,
				you reach the full text of the translation.
			</li>
		</ul>

    	<p><b>Do not forget</b> that:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				You can add another translation either from the original document or from any of its linguistic versions.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<br />
		<p>
			The "Add translation" command is to be used whenever you add a translated content.
			But, as outlined in the introduction to this chapter, you can translate only the name,
			title and description. Or you can even translate the properties of a content which
			has no text available in your target languageâ€¦
		</p>
		<p>
			 You have learned how to add translations. As looking at our examples,
			 you certainly have noticed that the multilingual documents seemed to show both basic
			 and specific properties, the latter known as "Multilingual Content Info".
			 So let us stop for a while and
