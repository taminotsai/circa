			The <b>general search</b> enables you to perform the most frequent queries.
			Therefore, you can take advantage of the advanced search to execute finer searches.
		</i></p>
		<p><i>
			The <b>advanced search</b> is purposed to building queries involving dates, time spans,
			specific file formats … You can also use it to search in specific sub-spaces or retrieve
			documents only in a given language .

				You key a query in the Look for search field;

				Additionally, you can select filters from the various options …

		<p>
			We expand '<b>Look in location</b>' to narrow searching to the interest group "Astrophysics".
			By checking <b>Include child spaces</b>, we request for its sub-spaces (in this example, "Library", "newsgroups"...)
			to be explored, also. We wish to have the <b>all items</b> explored.
			The results will be listed in any view of your choice ("detailed view", "icon view", etc).

		<h3>Search documents in a specific language</h3>

		<p>
			The Advanced search enables you to filter your search according to the language of the documents.
		</p>
		<p>
			With the Language search options, you can narrow your search to the results that have a version in
			your current language filter or in any language you wish.
			Alternatively, you can choose to search on documents in "all languages".

		<a name="Search_on_dates_or_time-span"></a>
		<h3>Search on dates or time-span</h3>

		<p>
			We can search any item (space as well as content) with its creation or modification date.
			If we are in a doubt about the precise date, we shall search over a period.
		</p>
		<p>
			To do so, we expand <b>More Search options</b> and make use of the search assistant.
		</p>
		<p>
			This allows us to ask for items created/modified
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Today</li>
			<li>On a given day</li>
			<li>Within a given time-span</li>
		</ul>

            <br />
            <span>Search with dates or periods</span>
		</div>
		<br />

		<p>
			This may be combined with any other Advanced Search action such as looking for a content stored in a precise format.

	    <h3>Search with the content format</h3>

	    <p>
		    This could be of some use to those who are working with a great variety of file formats.
		    For example, that provides an easy way to retrieve audio or multimedia contents, more quickly.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		    We open the menu matching the "<b>Search controls</b>" icon
			(&nbsp;<img alt="Search controls icon" src="../../../images/extension/help/search_controls.gif" />&nbsp;)
		    and we choose the Advanced Search mask. We expand <b>More search options</b>.
		    Then we scroll down the 'Content format' list and pick out a format.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		    Although you have reached a stage where you are skilled in building complex queries,
		    you would certainly appreciate not to repeat such task whenever you need to launch a same search.
		    Fortunately, you can save your requests.
