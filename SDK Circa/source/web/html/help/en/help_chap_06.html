		<p>
			The Library is the <b>space</b> where <b>contents</b> are stored, managed and shared.
		</p>

		<div class="borderNotCenter">
			<p>
				You said "<b>content</b>"â€¦ What do you mean?
			</p>
			<p>
				The content is the unit of information of the library.
			</p>
			<p>
				Each <b>content item</b> vehicles a set of information structured as a semantic whole,
				a meaning which may be supported by whatever type of medium (text, picture, video, sound,
				multimedia, a piece of software, a web page, etc).

	  	<h3>Whom is the Library intended for?</h3>

		<p>
			The IG Leader is free to grant public access to the Library. In this case any user,
			whether authenticated or not, can read contents.
		</p>
		<p>
			Otherwise, any IG member who has been
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				authenticated
			</li>
			<li>
				granted access to the Library
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			can read contents.
		</p>
		<p>
			Depending on the <b>role</b> they are allowed to play in the Library, the IG members can only read or
			perform further actions.<br />
			It should be noticed that the IG Leader can also deny access to the Library (or part of it)
			for some users, even authenticated.
		</p>

		<div class="borderNotCenter">
			<h4>The Library roles are:</h4>

		    <p>
				<b><i>No access:</i></b> the access to the Library is denied.
		    </p>
		    <p>
				<b><i>Access:</i></b> only allows reading contents; you can only download contents as well as their properties.
		    </p>
		    <p>
				<b><i>Edit only:</i></b> you can only edit any content; you cannot create nor delete any content.
		    </p>
		    <p>
				<b><i>Manage own:</i></b> you can create, edit and delete your own contents. You can only access the documents created and managed by the other members.
		    </p>
		    <p>
				<b><i>Full edit:</i></b> you can read and write on the whole Library; you can create contents; you can edit any content whoever be its author. But you can delete only your own contents.
		    </p>
		    <p>
				<b><i>Administrate:</i></b> basically, you have as many rights as the full-edit role. Additionally, you can delete any content. Moreover you can organise the Library and manage its users.
		    </p>
		</div>

		<p>
			It should be noticed that <b>the roles are not definitely assigned</b>.
			They can be changed at the initiative of your Interest Group leader or on request.

			The Library can be figured as a tree of folders (so-called 'spaces') filled with content.
			In the example below, "LIBRARY" is the library of our Interest group.
			It includes sub-spaces at two levels with sub-space "biodiversity" including "wild Birds".

			Each <b>space</b> of a Library is characterized by:

			<li>
				A set of <b>actions</b> authorized for the current user.

			<li>
				Each space can contain sub-spaces and/or content.

		<p>
			Each <b>content</b> item can be identified by:

		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Properties</b> (title, description);
			</li>
			<li>
				A set of <b>actions</b> authorized for the current user.
