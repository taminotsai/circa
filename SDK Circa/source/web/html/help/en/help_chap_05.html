		<h3>First-time access</h3>

		<p>
			The previous section has introduced the basics for accessing CIRCABC. You have now registered (if not an ECAS user) so that you have a CIRCABC username and password. You have then asked for becoming a member of an Interest Group.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now let us go on and discover our Interest Group.
		</p>
		<p>
			This figure shows how to navigate from the CIRCABC homepage to an Interest Group of which you have membership.

            <span>The services offered by your IG</span>
		</div>

		<p>
			You click "<b>Login</b>" in the main menu of the CIRCABC homepage and type in your user-name and password.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>The paragraph below</b> guides you from the authentication step up to accessing an interest group (titled "Animal welfare").
		</p>
		<p>
			First you click Login from the CIRCABC main menu and key in your username and password:

		<p>
			you choose a category header ("Others", in this example)...

			<b>Keep in mind</b> that any Interest Group is characterized by a <b>group of users</b>
			(potentially unlimited), a set of <b>services</b> (Library service, News, etc) and a collection of
			<b>contents</b> articulated along a main theme.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can now take a first glance at your IG. Its structure is figured below:
