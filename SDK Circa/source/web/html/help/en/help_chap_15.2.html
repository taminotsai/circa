	  	<h3>How to create an Event</h3>

		<p>
			Following the link "create Event" takes you to a three-stepped creation wizard. You will
			successively:
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Enter general information</li>
			<li>Define an audience</li>
			<li>Provide details about the organiser</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4>Step one - Enter general information</h4>

		<p>
			You give a name and description, the degree of priority, the place where the event will
			occur…
		</p>
		
		<div class="printScreen">
            <img alt="Events formular" title="Events formular" src="../../../images/extension/help/events-formular.PNG" />
            <br />
            <span>The title and abstract are not multilingual</span>
		</div>
		
		<p>
			During the step one, you set up the occurrence rate of the appointment. On the illustration
above, we prepared a single event: the option "Only once" is checked in the field "Occurs".
		</p>		
		<p>
			You set up a series of events, by combining a periodicity and a number of occurrences. In the
example below, we scheduled a weekly appointment which was repeated at three times:
		</p>
				
		<div class="printScreen">
            <img alt="Events formular occurs" title="Events formular occurs" src="../../../images/extension/help/events-formular-occurs.PNG" />
            <br />
            <span>Various periodicities are possible</span>
		</div>
		
		<h4>Step two - Define an audience</h4>
		
		<p>
			The event will be "open" or "closed".
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<b>Open<b/> events are limited to the membership of your interest group.
			<br/>
			<b>Closed<b/> events can bring together:
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>members of your interest group</li>
			<li>members of any other interest group on CIRCABC</li>
			<li>registered users (users with an identifier) being not invited in any interest group</li>
			<li>anonymous users (users without identifier)</li>
		</ul>
		
		<div class="printScreen">
            <img alt="Events formular audience" title="Events formular audience" src="../../../images/extension/help/events-formular-audience.PNG" />
            <br />
            <span>Every member of the interest group may attend this event</span>
		</div>
		
		<p>
			In the case of a closed event, you are proposed to list your invitees:
		</p>
		
		<div class="printScreen">
            <img alt="Events formular status" title="Events formular status" src="../../../images/extension/help/events-formular-status.PNG" />
            <br />
            <span>You can invite people from outside and inside CIRCABC</span>
		</div>
		
		<h4>Step three - Provide details about the organiser</h4>
		
		<p>
			Now you check the information about the organiser. You are free to modify it as you like. By
			default, you are the organiser of the event.
		</p>
		
		<div class="printScreen">
            <img alt="Events formular contact" title="Events formular contact" src="../../../images/extension/help/events-formular-contact.PNG" />
            <br />
            <span>You can indicate an organiser different from yourself</span>
		</div>
		
		<div class="topOfPage">
			<a href="#top" class="top">Top of the page&nbsp;<img src="../../../images/extension/help/top_ns.gif" alt="back to the top of the page" /></a>

	  	<h3>How to create an Meeting</h3>
		
		<p>
			Creating a meeting follows the steps described above plus another. This additional one gives
			you an opportunity to set a relation between the meeting you are scheduling and a space in the
			Library of your interest group.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			As setting up the meeting properties, you can select a subspace of the Library:
		</p>
		
		<div class="printScreen">
            <img alt="Events formular space" title="Events formular space" src="../../../images/extension/help/events-formular-meeting-space.PNG" />
            <br />
            <span>You could as well not to select any space</span>
		</div>
	
		<p>
			Later, the related space will be quoted on the details page of the meeting:
		</p>
		
		<div class="printScreen">
            <img alt="Events formular relevant space" title="Events formular relevant space" src="../../../images/extension/help/events-details-meeting-relevant-space.PNG" />
            <br />
            <span></span>
		</div>
		
		<p>
			The other sides of creating a meeting are like creating an event. Meetings can also be open or
			closed, single or recurrent.
		</p>
		
		<div class="topOfPage">

		</div>
		
		<a name="How_to_modify_events_and_meetings"></a>
	  	<h3>How to modify Events &amp; Meetings</h3>
		
		<p>
			Should you have to make changes in the meeting you have just scheduled, you take the set of
			properties to be modified through the actions pane on the right-hand part of the details page.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Change general information</h4>
		
		<p>
			You can modify almost every data. Keep in mind, however, that, presently, you cannot
			change the dates of a repeated appointment. Neither can the standard time zone.<br /><br />
			Select "Modify general information" from the action pane of the event details page and
			proceed to the changes:
		</p>
		
		<div class="printScreen">
            <img alt="Action menu" title="Action menu" src="../../../images/extension/help/events-meeting-actions-2.PNG" />
            <br />
            <span>Only "eveadmin" may reach this menu</span>
		</div>
		
		<h4>Modify contact information</h4>
		
		<p>
			This allows you give a different e-mail, phone, etc for the contact . The changes you introduce
			there are specific for the appointment you are scheduling. The CIRCABC user account of the
			contact is not affected.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Modify audience</h4>
		
		<p>
			You can swap an open audience for a closed one, and reversely.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Delete events</h4>
		
		<p>
			You access the command "delete" from the Actions list displayed on the details page of any Event.
		</p>
		
		<div class="printScreen">
            <img alt="Delete a meeting" title="Delete a meeting" src="../../../images/extension/help/events-meeting-actions-3.PNG" />
            <br />
            <span>Once deleted, the appointment is removed from the calendar</span>
		</div>
		
		<div class="borderText">
			<br />
			- But what did you provide about repeated events? Should I delete the whole
			appointment?<br />
			- You are given the choice of removing either single occurrences or the series, as shown
			below.
			<br /><br />
		</div>
		
		<p>
			<i>We have scheduled a meeting which should be repeated daily between the 1st and 3rd May 2009.</i>
		</p>
		
		<div class="printScreen">
            <img alt="Repeated Meeting" title="Repeated Meeting" src="../../../images/extension/help/events-calendar-meeting-occurs.PNG" />
            <br />
            <span>Once done, the only appointment of May, 2nd has been removed from the calendar</span>
		</div>
		
		<p>
			If you ever cancel the first appointment, the details of the meeting will be refreshed with the
			date of next occurrence. The field "start date", however, will not.
