	  	<h3>Modifying the properties of a translation</h3>

		<p>
			To change the properties of a translation, <b>click "Modify Content Properties"</b> from
			the Actions list in the "View details" page (accessible through icon
			<img alt="Edit Details" title="Edit Details" src="../../../images/extension/help/edit_properties.gif" />).
		</p>

		<div class="printScreen">
            <img alt="Modify translation properties" title="Modify translation properties" src="../../../images/extension/help/Action-ModifCOproperties.PNG" />
            <br />
            <span>Modify the properties of the translation currently displayed </span>
		</div>
		<br />

		<p>
			Most data can be changed as in any monolingual document.
			Replacing the language information, therefore, is specific for the translations.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since each language is taken out of the properties language list as soon as
			assigned to a translation, you are proposed a shortened list so as you have
			no risk of assigning twice a same language to two different linguistic versions.
			The language of the current translation, however, keeps appearing.
		</p>
 		<p>
			When modifying the properties of a translation, keep in mind that both translation
			name and language are compulsory data. So you cannot delete these fields.
		</p>

		<h4>Automatic changes</h4>

		<h5>Related translations</h5>

		<p>The translations reference list is automatically updated whenever</p>

		<ul>
			<li>you add or remove a translation;</li>
			<li>you change the name of a translation;</li>
			<li>you replace the language assigned to a translation</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			For instance, we detail the properties of c_16820070720hu00340037.pdf and replace Latvian
			with Hungarian. The list of related translations will read HU as the language
			of c_16820070720hu00340037.pdf:

	  	<h3>Updating a translation</h3>

		<p>
			You can update a translation as any monolingual document. Please, refer to
			<a title="Update a document" href="help.jsp?page=help_chap_07.2.html#How_to_modify_the_properties_of_a"><b>Update a document</b></a>
			for more details.

		</div>
		<br />

		<a name="Checking_out_a_translation"></a>
	  	<h3>Checking out a translation</h3>
		<p>
			This action is similar to checking out any monolingual content. The
			"<a title="Check out any content" href="help.jsp?page=help_chap_07.2.html#checkout"><b>Check out any contentâ€¦</b></a>"
			explains you how to do.
		</p>
		<p>
			The new version of the translation having been loaded and saved (see
			"<a title="How to Check in" href="help.jsp?page=help_chap_07.2.html#how_to_checkin"><b>How to Check in</b></a>"
			action),
			its <b>version number</b> is incremented.
		</p>
		<p>
			The <b>version number of the group of translations</b> is not changed. This is changed only if
			we make a new edition (the edition being an image of a group of translations at a time).
		</p>

		<a name="Deleting_a_translation"></a>
	  	<h3>Deleting a translation</h3>

		<p>
			You can delete translations as you do with any monolingual content, just by clicking the <b>Delete icon</b>
			(&nbsp;<img alt="Delete icon" title="Delete icon" src="../../../images/extension/help/delete.gif" />&nbsp;)
			in the Actions list of the "<b>translation details</b>" page (accessible through the <b>View details icon</b>
			&nbsp;<img alt="View details icon" title="View details icon" src="../../../images/extension/help/View_details.gif" />&nbsp;).
		</p>
		<p>
			The pivot translation, however, does not show any "Delete" icon.
			Please, keep in mind that you cannot delete the pivot translation as long
			as it has translations based on it.<br />
			So if you have to clear the content which has been chosen as a base for the other translations,
			you should first select another translation as the new pivot translation.
		</p>
		<p>
			Deleting all of the related translations enables you to clear the pivot translation also. The <b>Delete icon</b>
			(&nbsp;<img alt="Delete icon" title="Delete icon" src="../../../images/extension/help/delete.gif" />&nbsp;)
			becomes available from the "Details" page of the pivot translation.

		<a name="Managing_the_multilingual_content"></a>
	  	<h3>Managing the multilingual content</h3>

	  	<p>Remember that the multilingual content represents information common to both the original document and all its translations.</p>

		<div class="borderNotCenter">
			The "Multilingual content" area deals with the notion of <b>edition</b>.
			An edition could be defined like the <b>image of a group of translations at a time</b>.
			This means that any action performed over the multilingual content affects the whole
			group of translations.
			<br /><br />
			Therefore, you must be prudent while managing the multilingual content.
		</div>

		<p>
			The related actions are accessible through the "<b>Manage multilingual content</b>"
			command of the "Actions" list available from the content "details" page.
		</p>

            <span>Manage information about a group of translations</span>
		</div>
		<br />

		<p>Having selected "Manage multilingual content", you access a page showing:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				The properties of the multilingual content (such information is shared by all the translations of the original content);
			</li>
			<li>
				The list of the translations of the original content;
			</li>
			<li>
				The edition history (history of  the successive versions of the group of translations);
			</li>
			<li>
				An action list.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<br />
		<div class="printScreen">
            <img alt="Manage multilingual content" title="Manage multilingual content" src="../../../images/extension/help/Manage%20multiling%20content.PNG" />
            <br />
            <span>Manage multilingual content</span>
		</div>
		<br />

		<h4>Modifying the properties of the multilingual content</h4>

		<p>
			Do not forget that changing properties of the multilingual content affects the whole edition in which the modifications are made.
		</p>

		<p>
			In the example below , we change the language of the "pivot translation".

		</p>
		<div class="borderText">
			<i><b>Do not forget that this is the language of the original document.</b></i>
		</div>
		<p>
			CIRCABC allows you to change it under the following condition:
		</p>
		<div class="borderText">
			<i>
			<b>
				You must choose the new original language between the languages of the translations
				that are listed in the "Translations" pane of "Manage Multilingual Content" (see illustration above) .
			</b>
			</i>
		</div>

		<p>
			<i>
				In our example, English is the language of the pivot translation.
				Both the Hungarian and Bulgarian texts are based on it.
				For whatever reason, we consider that the translations added from now
				and onwards should be based on the Hungarian version.
				We choose Hungarian as the new "pivot translation".
			</i>
		</p>

		<p>
			First, we select "<b>Change Details</b>" from the Actions list of page "Manage multilingual content".
		</p>

		<p>
			We can modify the following properties (all of them relate to the original document):
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Author;</li>
			<li>pivot translation;</li>
			<li>security ranking;</li>
			<li>expiration date.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			We expand the languages list attached to the field "Pivot Translation":
			the languages there match the linguistic versions listed in the "related translations"
			pane of "Multilingual Content information" (see illustration above).
		</p>

		<br />
		<div class="printScreen">
            <img alt="How to change the language of the original content" title="How to change the language of the original content" src="../../../images/extension/help/change%20orig%20language.PNG" />
            <br />
            <span>How to change the language of the original content</span>
		</div>
		<br />

		<p>
			Once selected, the new original language is shown in the language field of the multilingual
			content properties.
		</p>

		<br />
		<div class="printScreen">
            <img alt="Hungarian is the new pivot-language" title="Hungarian is the new pivot-language" src="../../../images/extension/help/change%20orig%20language_After.PNG" />
            <br />
            <span>Hungarian is the new pivot-language</span>
		</div>
		<br />

		<p>
			Now you are proficient in managing the documents of the IG to which you have membership.
			You can download, add or delete contents. You know how to modify their properties or the
			information they contain. You can group them together with their translations to other languages.
