			The <b>general search</b> explores by default every space and content item.
			It reads the name and full content of each explored entity.
		</p>
		<p>
			Therefore, you can narrow your search to a sub-part of this corpus through
			the "<b>Search controls</b>" icon
			(&nbsp;<img alt="Search controls icon" src="../../../images/extension/help/search_controls.gif" />&nbsp;)
			that can be reached through menu
			left to the search box.  You will use the search controls to limit searching to
			either the names of the explored entities or their full content.
		</p>
		<p>
			All of the most frequent syntax combinations are allowed. The engine deals with proximity,
			makes use of Boolean operators and manages parenthesized expressions

			<h4>Would you wish to find  words next to one another?</h4>
			<p>
				- Just double-quote the expression you are looking for.
			</p>
		</div>

		<p>
			<i>
				Let us suppose that we are  looking for "inland shipping". We double-quote this expression and introduce it into the "Search" box.

		<div class="borderNotCenter">
			<h4>But what if we forget to double-quote the search term and simply write inland shipping?</h4>
			<p>
				- Nothing serious, indeed! The query is then computed as a request for
				any space or content including <b>either or both these words</b>. <br/>
				- In the example below, we have repeated our search, writing <i>inland shipping</i>.
				This query comes up with the 4 following results:

		</div>
		<br />

		<p>
			Not having detected double quotes, the search engine has interpreted the blank between
			the two words as "OR", the default Boolean operatorâ€¦

		<a name="Boolean_operators_OR_AND_NOT"></a>
		<h3>Boolean operators (OR, AND, NOT)</h3>

		<h4>About the Boolean operators</h4>

		<p>
			Please, keep in mind that, <b>currently, the search engine associated to CIRCABC only accepts the implicit OR</b>.
			The other Boolean operators such as AND and NOT could be implemented later.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>"OR"</b>, because the <b>default</b> operator, is <b>implicit</b>. Although implicit, it may be written in full, as well.
			In the following example:
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Bat bird</i><br />
			Is correct and is expected to be equivalent to<br />
			- Bat or bird
		</p>
 		<p>
			So, keying <b>OR</b> between two terms allows you to find the items which contain either or both these terms;
			while typing <b>AND</b> means that you ask for the items which contain both these terms.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Bat* and bird*</i><br />
			Comes up with documents containing both:<br />
			- any word starting with bat<br />
			- any word starting with bird
		</p>
 		<p>
			Classically enough, the <b>NOT</b> operator serves for excluding from the results set the documents containing the word it introduces.
		</p>

		<h4>Combining Boolean operators</h4>

		<p>You can build a query by <b>combining Boolean expressions</b>. You will then use <b>parentheses</b>. </p>

		<p>We are looking for items which contain:</p>

		<p>
			<i>"sustainable hunting"</i> <b>or both</b> <i>"birds"</i> and <i>"bats"</i>:<br />
			- "sustainable hunting" or (birds  and bats)
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>either the words</b> <i>"sustainable"</i> <b>and</b> <i>"hunting"</i> <b>or  the word</b> <i>"bird"</i> <b>and any word starting with</b> <i>"bat"</i>.<br />
			- (sustainable and hunting) or (bird and bat*)
		</p>

		<a name="Wildcard_searching"></a>
		<h3>Wildcard searching</h3>

		<p>The <b>* symbol</b> may be used in place of one or more characters, whether those exist or not. </p>

		<p>"*" can only replace the right part of any word; you can put it at any place in the word except for the first character.</p>

		<p>This means that the search word <b>bat*</b> accounts for words like:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>bat</li>
			<li>bats</li>
			<li>Bates</li>
			<li>battle</li>
			<li>etc</li>
		</ul>

		<div class="topOfPage">
			<a href="#top" class="top">Top of the page&nbsp;<img src="../../../images/extension/help/top_ns.gif" alt="back to the top of the page" /></a>
		</div>
		<br />

	    <a name="What_if_I_search_over_multilingual"></a>
	    <h3>What if I search over multilingual documents?</h3>

		The results are displayed differently according to whether or not you select a content language filter:

		<ul>
			<li>
				The monolingual documents are displayed in any case.
			</li>
			<li>
				The multilingual documents are displayed differently depending on your linguistic selection:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>If you do not select any content language filter</b>, the results list shows all the linguistic versions of each multilingual document.
					</li>
					<li>
					   <b>If you select a content language filter</b>, the results list contains the translations that match  your content language filter <b><i>(if they have a translation matching this filter)</i></b>.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Now let us imagine that a search comes up with a multilingual document which contains no translation
			in the language you have selected as a filter. If so, only the original document is listed as a result.
			The language code of the original document is then displayed next to the document name.
