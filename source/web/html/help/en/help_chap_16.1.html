			First you build a mask and click search. Examining the results, you can evaluate how
			pertinent your research is. If you agree with the criteria you have previously chosen, follow
			the link "Save new search". This can be found in the "actions" list, below "new search" and
			"close".<br/>
			You are requested for providing a name and description to the saved request.
		</p>

		<p>
			Please, keep in mind that:
			<ul>
				<li>You cannot give a same name to two different searches</li>
				<li>You cannot delete a saved search</li>
