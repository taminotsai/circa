			Specific roles have been defined for this service. So, depending on your access profile, you
			can you are granted with one of these roles:
		</p>

		<div class="borderNotCenter">
			<h4>The Events roles are:</h4>

		    <p>
				<b><i>Administer:</i></b> provides full control over the Events service.
		    </p>
		    <p>
				<b><i>Access:</i></b> allows to read the calendar in the Events service.
		    </p>
		    <p>
				<b><i>No access:</i></b> refuses access to the Events service.
		    </p>
		</div>

		<p>
			The IG Leaders are the only ones who can administer events. If you are an IG Leader, please,
			visit the Leader guide to know more about creating, managing or deleting events.<br /><br />
			Most of the access profiles may access the calendar by default.<br /><br />
			By default also, guests (those who have no username) and registered users external to the
			interest group may not access to the Events service.<br /><br />
			Both "Eveaccess" and "Evenoaccess" can be configured by the interest group leader so that
			public at large, as well as any registered user, can look at the appointments made.
