	  	<h3>Why to become a Member of an interest group?</h3>
		<p>
			What makes membership attractive is the possibility to perform a wide range of actions over the
			contents, to be able to exchange views with the other members, so, to be able to collaborate
			closely with people who are sharing your concerns and projects.
		</p>
			<div class="borderText">
				<br />
				Membership is free-of-charge.<br />
				A unique user name and password allows you to become a member of several Interest Groups
				<br /><br />
			</div>
		<p>
			Your rights to access contents depend on the access profile the IG leader has assigned to you.

	  	<h3>Apply for membership</h3>
		<p>
			Once you have passed through the authentication step and browsed the categories, you can reach
			a list of the IGs which are available to you. These are classified under three headings mirroring
			the CIRCABC-IPM main access types:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Members</b>: shows the interest groups for which you have <b>Membership</b>.
				This class is displayed if you have at least one membership.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Registered access</b>: lists the interest groups of which you may <b>become a Member</b>.
				This appears if you have made a login. Please note that the IGs classified under "registered access"
				are not visible to those who do not access through "Login".
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Public access</b>: lists the interest groups which are <b>accessible to everybody</b> irrespective of
				authentication. This is displayed even if you do not make a login.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<div class="borderText">
			<br />
			The Interest Groups that are partly for public and partly for authorized access are listed as "registered access".
			<br /><br />
		</div>
		<p>
			Once logged in, you choose an Interest group among those listed under "registered access".
			The link "<b>Join this group</b>" is available from two places:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Besides its name, in the list of the interest groups with "registered access"
			</li>
			<li>
				From the Welcome page of the interest group along with "contact" information
			</li>
		</ul>
	    <div class="printScreen">
                <img alt="Click 'join this group' to apply for membership." title="Click 'join this group' to apply for membership." src="../../../images/extension/help/Contact%20info.PNG" />
                <br />
                <span>How to apply for membership of interest group "Astrophysics"</span>
		</div>
		<p>
			The "<b>Apply for membership</b>" page is split in two areas:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				The first one informs you about how to contact the IG leader
			</li>
			<li>
				The second area allows you to apply and, if you wish so, to put forth the reasons for your application.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Having filled out the application form, you press the "submit" button. The application reacts by
			displaying the following message:
		</p>
		<div class="borderText">
			<br />
			<i>"Your application to the Interest Group has been taken into account. A mail is forwarded to the Interest Group Leader(s)".</i>
			<br /><br />
		</div>
		<p>
			Now it is for the interest group leader to accept or refuse to invite you. You are notified by e-mail of your new membership.
		</p>
		<p>
			Your application has been accepted so you have got membership.  Now you are ready to participate in the life of your Interest Group.
