			You can start a search from any location in your interest group. You find text from the name, title and full text of any content and from the name of any space.

		<p>
			You may want to find out two or more words next to one another? Just double-quote the
expression you are looking for.
		</p>

		<p><i>
			Let us look for the expression "Wild birds". We double-quote it into the search box. Our
request comes up with one result, a space titled "Wild birds":

		<div class="borderNotCenter">
			<h4>But what if we <b>forget to double-quote</b> the search term and simply write wild bird?</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Nothing serious, indeed! The search is a little more "noisy" since the search engine
					looks for any space or content including <b>either or both these words</b> (as shown
					below).
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

			<br /><i>
			Keying <b>OR</b> between two terms allows you to find the items containing either or both
			these terms; typing <b>AND</b> means that you ask for the items which contain both these
			terms.
			</i><br /><br />
		</div>

		<p>
			A blank character set between two words means "OR", the default Boolean operator.

			The request <i>Wild birds</i> comes up with
			<ul>
				<li>the items containing only the word "wild"</li>

			The asterisk symbol (*) may be used in place of one or more characters, existing or not. It can

			<i>*ouse stands for</i> <i>house, playhouse, grouse, etc</i>
			<i>C*an stands for</i> <i>cetacean, cyan, can, etc</i>

			The general search enables you to perform the most frequent queries. And you can take
			advantage of the advanced search to execute fine-tuned requests.

	  	<h3>How to conduct an advanced search</h3>

		<p>
			The queries you make through the advanced search can involve more criteria like dates, time
			spans, specific file formats. You can also look at specific sub-spaces or retrieve only
			documents in a given language.
		</p>

            <span>This option is available from the main menu</span>
		</div>

		<p>
			Clicking <b>"advanced search"</b> takes you to a detailed interface from which you can select
			various kinds of data. For instance, you can read the whole interest group or narrow the
			exploration to the service (Library, Newsgroups, etc) from which you have launched the
			advanced search. You can even limit the checking to a very location inside a service.

            <span>This request explores all spaces and contents of the Library</span>
		</div>

		<p>
			The various areas of the search mask are linked together with the operator "AND".
		</p>

		<p>
			The other information potentially explored by the search engine are:
			<ul>
				<li>title, description and author</li>
				<li>keywords assigned</li>
				<li>any type of date or time span</li>
				<li>the file format</li>
				<li>additional information such as the status, security ranking , reference or URL</li>

			You can also check documents written in

				<li>all languages</li>
				<li>the content language you have set</li>
				<li>another language</li>
