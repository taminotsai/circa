		<p>
			CIRCABC is a web-based application, so, obviously, you need an <b>internet connection</b>.
			You also need a <b>browser</b> (Internet Explorer 5 or higher, Firefox…).
		</p>
		<p>
			You must use a <b>valid and unique e-mail address</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			And you should know at least the URL of your CIRCABC application or the URL
			of the interest group you wish to consult or participate in.

			<dt>
				Users are spread into <b>two domains</b> according to the way they access CIRCABC:<br /><br />
			</dt>
			<dd>
				<b>The Commission's civil servants and external staff working "intra muros"</b> are not
				requested for any initial registration to CIRCABC.
				They directly log in CIRCABC and apply for membership in
				Interest Groups (IG). Moreover, they benefit of the <b>single sign on</b>.
				That allows them to authenticate only once through the European Commission's
				Authentication Service (ECAS).<br /><br />

		<p>
			Users, external as well as European institutions' staff, log in CIRCABC through the European Commission's Authentication Service (ECAS). You need an ECAS username and password. If you ever need several usernames, keep in mind that you must use one e-mail address per username.

	    <h4><span>Is the access to CIRCABC public?</span></h4>

	    <p>
		    Although working in a private workspace, certain interest groups enable public access
		    to some of their services. So they make some documents accessible to everybody,
		    whether or not authenticated while the rest of their library is reserved for authenticated users.
	    </p>

	    <h4><span>You get in CIRCABC...</span></h4>

	    <h5><span>Via public access...</span></h5>

		<p>
			You are connected as a guest. No login is required but it should be noted that not all the Interest Groups
			have documents available this way: you can access only the contents which have been granted "public"
			accessibility.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You can only see the interest groups  visible to not-logged users</li>
			<li>You can only read and download documents from the interest groups open to public access</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			If wishing to collaborate more closely in an Interest Group, you are warmly advised to <b>register</b>.
		</p>
	    <h5><span>Via authenticated access...</span></h5>

	    <p>
	    	Before joining an interest group, you may be granted very limited access rights by the Interest Group
	    	Leader.<br />
			The registered users, however, may submit applications for membership in an Interest Group.
	    </p>

	    <h4><span>Getting a CIRCABC account</span></h4>

		<div class="borderText">
			<br />
			A unique username and password allows you to apply for membership of several interest groups.
			<br /><br />
		</div>

	    <h5><span>Register procedure</span></h5>

	    <p>
	    	You will obtain your own CIRCABC account by following the "<b>Register</b>" procedure.<br />
			You click <b>register</b> from the CIRCABC main menu.<br />
		</p>
		<p>
			This takes you to a registration form which consists of the following areas:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Identity (personal data and information required to let you be identified
				as a CIRCABC user);
			</li>
			<li>
				Contact information (this may be useful for getting in touch with the other
				members of the IGs you will participate in);
			</li>
			<li>
				Security check (information needed for checking purpose).
			</li>
		</ul>

		</div>

	    <p>
		    You create your own password and user name:Your password should contain 8 characters or more.
		    It must contain at least three types of characters in the following four :
	    </p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				upper case (A to Z);
			</li>
			<li>
				lower case (a to z);
			</li>
			<li>
				numeric (0 to 9);
			</li>
			<li>
				special characters (namely, !"#$%&amp;'()*+?-./:;&lt;=&gt;?@[\]^_`{|}~).

                <span>Bulk-registration finder</span>
		</div>
		<p>
			This CAPCHA test verifies that the current registration has not been issued by a robot
			programmed for running bulk registrations. An equivalent audio message is played for
			visually-impaired users.
		</p>

	    <h5><span>Some more about visibility of your personal information</span></h5>

	    <p>
		    If you wish to be easily contacted by the other members of the Interest Group and
		    let them know more about your domain(s) of excellence, for instance, you will choose
		    to authorize everybody in the IG to see your user information.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    	If not, you will deny such authorization. Only the Interest Group leader, category
	    	administrator and CIRCABC-IPM administrator will be able to access your whole user
	    	information. All of the IG other members will see only your user name, first name and surname.
	    </p>

	    <h5><span>Register</span></h5>

	    <p>
		    If you have filled out all the mandatory fields, if your password complies with the password
		    rules and if… you are not a robot, you have just to <b>confirm your request for an
		    account</b> by pressing on the "<b>Register</b>" button.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    	Your request for registration has been recorded and processed. The message below is displayed:
	    </p>
	    <div class="printScreen">
                <img alt="do not forget to activate your registration!" title="do not forget to activate your registration!" src="../../../images/extension/help/Congratulations.PNG" />
                <br />
                <span>Congratulations!</span>
		</div>
		<p>
			If you ever get an error message (password does not match, e-mail missing, etc)… just correct
			and validate again through the "Register" button.
		</p>

	    <h5><span>How and when do I receive my CIRCABC account?</span></h5>

	    <p>
	    	Once you have filled out and submitted the registration form, you receive an e-mail with a
	    	hyperlink towards CIRCABC:
	    </p>
	    <div class="printScreen">
                <img alt="Click the link to activate your CIRCABC account" title="Click the link to activate your CIRCABC account" src="../../../images/extension/help/Activation%20link.PNG" />

                <span>Click on this link to activate your CIRCABC account</span>
		</div>

	    <h5><span>How to activate my account?</span></h5>

	    <p>
	    	You follow the above-mentioned hyperlink. This is an activation URL which takes you to a "Login" page.
	    	You type in the <b>user name</b> sent to you and the <b>password</b> you had created as registering.
	    	Your account is activated.<br />
			If not yet activated after 60 days, your CIRCABC account will be removed.
	    </p>

	    <h5><span>What if I have forgotten my user-name?</span></h5>

	    <p>
	    	You can reset it by yourself, very easily. You follow the "<b>forget your password?</b>" link that
	    	can be seen on the Login page. This takes you to a "<b>re-send password</b>" page whereon you are
