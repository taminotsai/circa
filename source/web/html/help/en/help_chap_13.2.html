	  	<h3>What do we call a "dossier"?</h3>

		<p>
			A dossier is a <b>thematic group of links</b> set to contents or spaces dispread throughout the library of
			your interest group. It is important to note that dossiers do not contain the documents themselves,
			only links.
		</p>

		</div>
		<br />

		<a name="Dossier_where"></a>
	  	<h3>Where can you find dossiers?</h3>

		<p>
			A "dossier" is a <b>particular space</b> of the library (or a sub-space in a space of the library).
			It is usually symbolised by icon
			(&nbsp;<img alt="The spaces with this icon are dossiers" title="The spaces with this icon are dossiers" src="../../../images/extension/help/space-icon-pen-16.gif" />&nbsp;).
			Its properties are of a space, not of content, and you can perform on it only actions usually applied to spaces.
		</p>

		<a name="dossiers_read"></a>
	  	<h3>How to read dossiers?</h3>

		<p>
			You just need the library (or the space in which dossier has been created) to be accessible to you.
			In other words, you can read dossiers if you can visit the library through any of its
			<a href="help.jsp?page=help_chap_07.0.html" title="The roles related to Library">associated roles</a>
			except "no access".
		</p>
		<p>
			You can then browse a dossier as any space of the library, keeping in mind that "contents",
			in a dossier, means "links". The dossier, being a space, may host specific sub-spaces.
		</p>

	  	<h3>How to create dossiers?</h3>

		<h4>Who may create dossiers</h4>

		<p>
			Creating a dossier requires that you may create a space in the library of the interest group.
			To do so, you need to be granted the role "administrate" over the library.
		</p>

		<h4>How can I make a dossier?</h4>

		<p>
			You connect the library (or the sub-space of library where you wish to create a dossier).
			The option "create dossier" is shown under header "Library", in the services list.
		</p>
		<p>
			Clicking "create dossier" launches the space creation wizard. At this step, you make a new space. Once built, this space shows icon
			(&nbsp;<img alt="The spaces with this icon are dossiers" title="The spaces with this icon are dossiers" src="../../../images/extension/help/space-icon-pen-16.gif" />&nbsp;).
			so as to be recognized as a dossier.
		</p>

		<br />
		<div class="printScreen">
            <img alt="A new dossier is created in a subspace of the Library" title="A new dossier is created in a subspace of the Library" src="../../../images/extension/help/Dossiers-List.PNG" />
            <br />
            <span>Dossier "Food safety" created in the subspace "UCM09" of the Library</span>
		</div>
		<br />

		<p>
			Having built the structure, you start recording information in your new dossier.
			<b>Do not forget that you cannot add contents in this kind of space</b>.
			So you will establish links to the contents you would like to access from your dossier.
		</p>
		<p>
			To do so, just select and copy the contents or spaces you wish.
			Then, you display the dossier main page. Now you paste as links the selected
			contents and/or spaces. Remember that <b>"Paste as link"</b> is symbolised by icon
  			(&nbsp;<img alt="Paste as link icon" title="Paste as link icon" src="../../../images/extension/help/paste_link.gif" />&nbsp;)
		</p>

		<div class="printScreen">

            <br />
            <span>The dossier is populated with links to contents, spaces and other dossiers</span>
		</div>
		<br />

		<p>
			It is important to note that you can set two links to a same document in a same dossier.
		</p>

		<div class="borderNotCenter">
			<h4>Now what if I wish my dossier to refer to another dossier?</h4>
			<p>
				- You just set a link targeting this other dossier.

			<h4>Depending on the role you play over the library, you can perform actions ranging from viewing to deleting:</h4>

		    <p>
				<b><i>Access:</i></b> you can display dossiers, follow and email links, view a discussion about a dossier.
		    </p>
		    <p>
				<b><i>Edit only:</i></b> you can display and edit dossiers, follow and email links, edit links in a dossier, view a discussion about a dossier.
		    </p>
		    <p>
				<b><i>Manage own:</i></b> you can display and edit dossiers, follow and email links, view a discussion about a dossier. You can add, edit and delete your own links. You delete your own dossiers, only.
		    </p>
		    <p>
				<b><i>Full edit:</i></b> you have same rights as "manage own".
		    </p>
		    <p>
				<b><i>Administrate:</i></b> you have same rights as "full-edit". Moreover, you start discussions about dossiers.
		    </p>
		</div>

		<h4>How to modify the details of a dossier?</h4>
		<p>
			You will find the command <b>"edit dossier properties"</b> in the properties list of the dossier.
			This list is accessible through the icon "View details" next to the dossier name on the main
			page of its parent space, meaning the library or any Library's sub-space).
		</p>


		<h4>How to manage discussions over a dossier?</h4>
		<p>
			The procedure is quite similar to creating and managing discussions over whichever space of the library.
 		</p>

		<h4>More actions</h4>
		<p>
			Following your role in the library, you can also cut or copy dossiers,
			in the same way as you cut/copy any space of the library.
