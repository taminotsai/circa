	  	<h3>Check out any content and check in</h3>

		"<b>Check out</b>" provides you with a <b>working copy</b> whereto adding changes
		while the main document <b>remains locked</b> for anybody but you, so that nobody
		else may modify the concerned content before you unlock it by yourself.
		You save the working copy, locally.
		You will make all the changes you wish in this replication.
		Once done, you will "<b>check in</b>".

	  	<h4>Where can I run "Check out" from?</h4>

		<p>
			"<b>Check out</b>" is available from the "Actions" list of the "View details" page of the content to be modified.
		</p>

		<br />
		<div class="printScreen">
            <img alt="'Check out' in the 'View details' page" title="'Check out' in the 'View details' page" src="../../../images/extension/help/Menu_Checkout.PNG" />
            <br />
            <span>"Check out" in the "View details" page</span>
		</div>
		<br />

		<h4>How to check out?</h4>

		<p>
			You have selected "check out"; a working copy is created either in the current
			space or in any space you select. This copy looks like any content with its properties,
			its information content and a set of potential actions.
		</p>
		<p>
			You are proposed to edit the working copy to your own system so that you can add changes
			at your convenience. You can also decide to edit later.
		</p>
		<p>
			Keep in mind, therefore, that the checked-out content has been locked as soon
			as you have created the working copy. It will remain locked so long as
			you will keep the working copy available.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since you have created the working copy, you can see the "locked by owner" icon
			(&nbsp;<img  alt="Locked by owner icon" src="../../../images/extension/help/locked_owner.gif">&nbsp;)
			next to the content name. For instance,
			<img alt="Locked by owne" src="../../../images/extension/help/Locked%20by%20owner.PNG">
		</p>
		<p>
			Every other IG member only see the "locked"
			(&nbsp;<img alt="Locked icon" src="../../../images/extension/help/locked.gif">&nbsp;)
			icon. So, <img alt="Locked" src="../../../images/extension/help/Locked%20action.PNG">
		</p>

		<p>
			Having captured all the modifications you need into your local working copy,
			you are ready to check in. At this stage, none of the other IG members is
			able to work on the very content you have modified.
		</p>

		<br />
		<div class="borderNotCenter">
			<h4>What if I change my mind and wish not any longer to modify my document?</h4>
			<p>
				While you will not have checked in, you will be given a possibility to give up the
				check out action. To do so, you display the "<b>View details</b>" page of the Working copy
				and select "<b>Undo check out</b>"
				(&nbsp;<img alt="Undo check out icon" src="../../../images/extension/help/undo%20checkout%20action.PNG">&nbsp;)
				from the Actions list. The working copy is deleted.
			</p>
		</div>

		<a name="how_to_checkin"></a>
		<h4>How to check in?</h4>

		<p>
			To upload the modified document and make the content to be unlocked, you <b>check in</b> the working copy.
		</p>
		<p>
			To so doing, just click the "check in" icon
			(&nbsp;<img alt="Check in icon" src="../../../images/extension/help/CheckIn_icon.gif">&nbsp;).
			This is located in the <b>Actions list of the Working copy "View details" page</b>:
		</p>

		<br />
		<div class="printScreen">
            <img alt="Check in in the 'View details' page" title="Check in in the 'View details' page" src="../../../images/extension/help/Menu_Checkin.PNG" />

            <span>"Check in" in the "View details" page</span>
		</div>
		<br />

		<p>
			As a result,
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				The content of the working copy is moved to the original content.
			</li>
			<li>
				The working copy is deleted.
			</li>
			<li>
				The original content item is <b>automatically unlocked</b>.

	  	<h3>Update a document</h3>

		<p>
			The Editor can <b>update documents</b> in the Library (except for documents that have been temporarily locked).
		</p>

		<h4>Wherefrom can I start the Update action?</h4>

		<p>
			Let us go on with the above example. Let us imagine that we have to load a new version of the document titled
			"Birds agreement". We click the "<b>Update</b>" icon
			(&nbsp;<img alt="Update icon" src="../../../images/extension/help/update.gif">&nbsp;)
			from the "content item" short description as shown in the "content items" area of the Library "Browse" page.
		</p>
		<p>
			The "Update" action can be run, also, via the content properties page: click "<b>View details</b>"
			(&nbsp;<img alt="View details icon" src="../../../images/extension/help/View_details.gif">&nbsp;).
			Then pick "<b>Update</b>" from the Actions list.
		</p>

            <img alt="Select Update from the 'View details'" title="Select Update from the 'View details'" src="../../../images/extension/help/menu%20update.PNG" />
            <br />
            <span>Select "update" from the "View details" page</span>
		</div>
		<br />

		<h4>How can I load a new version of a content?</h4>

		<p>
			By clicking the <b>Update</b> icon
			(&nbsp;<img alt="Update icon" src="../../../images/extension/help/update.gif">&nbsp;),
			you access the Update form:
		</p>

		<br />
		<div class="printScreen">
            <img alt="Update a content with new information" title="Update a content with new information" src="../../../images/extension/help/Update%20a%20content.PNG" />
            <br />
            <span>Update a  content with new information</span>
		</div>
		<br />

		<p>
			Just select the document to be loaded and click <b>Upload</b>.
			Your new version of the document is uploaded.
			A confirmation message is displayed and the "Update" button becomes active.
		</p>

		<br />
		<div class="printScreen">
            <img alt="Select Update from the 'View details'" title="Select Update from the 'View details'" src="../../../images/extension/help/menu%20update.PNG" />
            <br />
            <span>The "update content" is completed</span>
		</div>
		<br />

		<p>
			Click <b>Update</b> in order to validate the action.
			The content is updated with the document you have just uploaded.
			You are taken back to the main page of the Library.
		</p>

		<p>
			Notice that you can give up any action before its term just by pressing
			the <b>Cancel</b> button that appears on each page of the action form.
