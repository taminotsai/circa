	  	<h3>Making links</h3>

	  	<p>
	  		First it's important to keep in mind that the links you create must point to documents inside your interest group.
	  	</p>

	  	<ol>
	  		<li>
		  		Having accessed the library (or a library's subspace) of your interest group,
		  		you select and <b>copy</b> the contents or spaces you would like to link to.
	  		</li>
	  		<li>
		  		The copied items appear along with "paste" and "remove" icons, in the <b>clipboard view</b>, on left hand.
	  		</li>
	  		<li>
	  			Navigate to the space where you wish to have links recorded.
	  		</li>
	  		<li>
	  			Then click the icon <b>"paste as link"</b>
	  			(&nbsp;<img alt="Paste as link icon" title="Paste as link icon" src="../../../images/extension/help/paste_link.gif" />&nbsp;)
	  			besides each item name.
	  		</li>
		</ol>

		<br />
		<div class="printScreen">
            <img alt="Click 'paste as link' to build a link to this content" title="Click 'paste as link' to build a link to this content" src="../../../images/extension/help/Links-paste%20as%20link.PNG" />
            <br />
            <span>Click the icon "paste as link"</span>
		</div>
		<br />

		<p>
			A link is built and pasted in the space you wish (the Library or any of its subspaces).
			It is explicitly shown as <b>"link to"</b> and is symbolised with <b>"link icon"</b>
  			(&nbsp;<img alt="Link icon" title="Link icon" src="../../../images/extension/help/lnk.gif" />&nbsp;)
		</p>

		<div class="borderNotCenter">
			<h4>What about multilingual documents? Can I link to a translation?</h4>
			<p>
				- Yes, you can. Please, note however that such links will be lost in case of a new
				edition of the related multilingual document.

	  	<h3>Viewing and editing the properties of a link</h3>

	  	<p>
	  		A link created so is given a limited set of properties and actions.
	  		We can see in "link destination" its most specific property.
	  		This informs you about the location of the linked-to content.
	  	</p>
		<p>
			As for any content, the properties and actions can be seen through the link's <b>"view details"</b> page
  			(&nbsp;<img alt="View the properties of the link" title="View the properties of the link" src="../../../images/extension/help/View_details.gif" />&nbsp;)
		</p>

		<br />
		<div class="printScreen">
            <img alt="Display the properties of the link" title="Display the properties of the link" src="../../../images/extension/help/Links-links%20properties.PNG" />
            <br />
            <span>Link properties such as displayed through the "view details" page</span>
		</div>
		<br />

		<p>
			As usually, the actions you can perform over a link depend on the role you may play in the library.
			Those who have been granted the role "full edit" ("Libfulledit") or "administrate" ("Libadmin")
			can do the most. This means that they can  cut, copy or delete links. They can also modify the name,
			title or description of the link. The link destination, as for it, is added automatically and cannot
			be changed.

		<a name="Download_link"></a>
	  	<h3>Downloading through links</h3>

		<p>
			To download the linked-to document, just press the name of the link from the library's main page
			(or the main page of the space containing the link).
		</p>

		<div class="topOfPage">
			<a href="#top" class="top">Top of the page&nbsp;<img src="../../../images/extension/help/top_ns.gif" alt="back to the top of the page" /></a>

		<a name="Edit_link"></a>
	  	<h3>Editing links</h3>

		<p>
			You can move, copy/paste or delete links.  But actions really specific of contents such as
			making multilingual or versioning are irrelevant regarding links.
		</p>
		<p>
			Several links can be grouped together thematically. This is what we are to explore now
			through the creation and management of dossiers.
