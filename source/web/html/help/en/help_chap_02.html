		<p>
			CIRCABC ("Communication and Information Resource Centre for Administrations,
			Businesses and Citizens") is used to create collaborative
	   	 	workspaces where communities of users can work together over the web
	   	 	and share information and resources.
		</p>
		<p>
	      	It is intended to replace
			CIRCA (Communication and Information Resource Centre for
	      	Administrations), an e-government
	      	solution supporting the online collaborative activities of the European
	      	Union's public administrations.
	      	Since 1997, CIRCA has been running as an IDA(BC) service and has been
	      	used by more than 30 Directorates-General and in particular by the
	      	committees and consultative bodies established to support collaboration
	     	between the Member States
	      	and the EU institutions. More than 100 national administrations have
	      	received a free licence and use it for their own needs.
		<p>
	      	The CIRCABC groupware
	      	enhances the performance of CIRCA in terms of capacity, security, availability and
	      	interoperability. Its user interface will be available in 23 languages.
	      	Moreover it is adapted to the needs of visually-impaired people.

	    <p>
			CIRCABC calls an <b>Interest Group</b>
			(IG) the private workspace designed for and shared by a community of users,
			meaning people working together on a specific topic. Each interest group is managed by
			one or more interest group leaders.
		</p>
	    <p>
			Several Interest Groups and related information are gathered into <b>categories</b>
	    </p>
	    <p>
			An Interest Group may be entirely or partly public (no authentication required) or with registered access (access reserved for its members).
	    </p>
	    <p>
			An Interest Group is characterised by:
	    </p>
		<ul>
	      <li>
			One or more responsible leaders
	      </li>
	      <li>
			A set of services (see below);
	      </li>
	      <li>
			A set of services (see below);
	      </li>
	      <li>
			A collection of contents brought together under a main topic.
	      </li>
	    </ul>

   	    <h4><span>One or more responsible leader</span></h4>

	    <p>
			The user responsible for managing the Interest Group is known as the <b>leader</b>.
	    </p>

	    <h4><span>A group of users</span></h4>

	    <p>
			Other users may be granted more or less access rights depending on the <b>user access profile</b> the leader has assigned to them.
	    </p>

	    <h4><span>A set of services</span></h4>

	    <p>
			<b><i>Library:</i></b> the library can be described as a tree of folders (so-called "spaces") filled with content. This is the place where the documents are stored, managed and shared. They can be viewed, downloaded, modified, versioned, sent by e-mail, etc. They can be grouped together with their translations into multilingual editions.
	    </p>
	    <p>
			<b><i>Members' directory:</i></b> this service provides information on registered users (who can apply for membership in any Interest Group). The members of an Interest Group can ask for their contact information to be hidden from or shown to the other members.
	    </p>
	    <p>
			<b><i>Newsgroups:</i></b> these groups provide a forum where the members of an Interest Group can discuss a topic or the documents they are sharing.
	    </p>
	    <p>
			<b><i>Meeting spaces:</i></b> a meeting space is made available for announcements and agendas. It includes a chat room to host virtual meetings.
	    </p>
	    <p>
			<b><i>Information pages:</i></b> web pages enable users to present data in an attractive format. They can include a short presentation of the Interest Group as well as contacts for information.
	    </p>
	    <p>
			<b><i>Surveys:</i></b> optionally, users can build and follow up surveys through the integration of CIRCABC with IPM (Interactive Policy-Making).
	    </p>

	    <h4><span>A collection of contents</span></h4>

	    <p>
			The contents are grouped into <b>spaces</b> and/or <b>sub-spaces</b>. The so-called spaces are simply folders.
